#### this is probably a diary, which is kinda cool
i save random quotes even when i don't fully understand them (yet)
i'm really into minesweeper and sudoku rn idk why

LISTEN, i use outlook just to mask my REAL gmail, since it has my REAL name in it
whew, luckily i can forward them so i don't have to open outlook

3 hours of doomscrolling, i'm so screwed
me when my discord account got false banned for being underaged...
wtf you mean "underaged", i'm literally 18 broooo

just finished with my first hyprland rice, kinda happy with it :3
i'm considering making a gallery section to post random images, idk about that thou

i swear how i didn't know the existence of the &lt;pre&gt; class :sob: that would have saved me so much time
the word "silly" is too overused to the point it's so bland and meaningless now (personally)

1st day of july: pride month subscription ended annddd it's chicken wings day!!
i hope everyone got the best chicken wings today (totally not an implication)

2.7: if you ask me what makes me regret the most,,, it's me not using proton mail in the first place, now it's so freaking painful to switch my accounts üò≠Ô∏è
the 'degoogle' has started, thank you pewdiepie

i haven't eaten anything "solid" for days straight. the oral ulcer monster came back to haunt me :c

i crave noodles
i crave noodles
i. crave. noodles.
but i just can't eat it at this moment üò≠Ô∏è

i just switched to nvim!!!

popular opinion: indomie is so peam, literally the best noodles i've ever had in my life!!!!
(i've never been to indonesia, but i may travel there in the near future, i heard street foods there are amazing :o)

(update 4.7) i haven't slept for over 30 hours, feel like dying rn...
but no worries, i'll still have to be alive to be the dreamy kid, right? :)
so close, yet so far, i feel like i'm so close to my goal (42 hours of no sleeping....)
guys 3 days, i see hallucinations now, and i'm so so tired jeez

(7.7) it's 4 am and the worst thing has come.... i'm hungry :c
i can't do anything now
so hungry

4 days...
i started working on my doom-inspired game and it's going pretty well :p

8 jul, i'm insanely tired today, i guess i can only handle 4 days staying awake
i'm gonna sleep for the rest of the day

i have just finished the whole final destination series (in 2 days)
i must say it's a really good one with an unique plot, even though season 4 is not really good..

i just found out i might have the coffee immunity, i have drank 4 cups of coffee today and yet i'm still really (and i mean really) tired

sometimes i just wish the happy moments can be forever, but i guess that's not how it was supposed to work

shesh i haven't done anything major in days
i have spent them lying on bed because my head hurts and it's so dizzy when i stand up.
i hope i can get through this even without any supports

it's funny how everything i receive after being truthful and thoughtful is silence
for some stupid reason, my terminal automatically opened itself recursively this morning when i open my laptop, that shit took me like 3 hours to fix (so unproductive :sob:)
but i still believe switching to plain arch is better than arch-"based" distros!!!

i love acoustic songs so much, they are so calming!!!!
i really should care about myself more.
so that i can really be my true self
it honestly feels great to express everything to someone else

holy smoke, already 20th of July?? time really flies isnt it
i'm being absolute braindead and my insanely terrible memory is getting even worse now

nevermind, indomie is actually the best-selling of the instant noodles world, no wonder why it's so amazing!!!
my wallet just hates me now, there's nothing in there when i wish there are......
animations update soon???

my laptop is tweaking so hard rn, i should consider building a new one
