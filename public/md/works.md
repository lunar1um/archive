## my recent (or everything significant) i have to offer
### lazy tools
i'm lazy, and so are all of us, my goal is to make tools for us, *the lazy people*.  
they are all available on my **github**, if u have any ideas or suggestions, don't be afraid to contact me! (i won't bite)  

### this website
yup,,, it has been rebuilt **4 times**, with **2 different frameworks**,  
and here we are, react with vite, no idea if i should host on github sites or vercel, i think both work  

### soggy icons pack!
i love soggy cat <3  
(it's also on my github by the way)
