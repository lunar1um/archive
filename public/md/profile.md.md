## hi! i'm lunar.
or also known as..
- luna
- celestial
- lemon
- linear
- lunaris (i really like this)
- [my actual name]

### about
i'm someone who thinks too much, has a short memory and is really expressive with my feelings,  
i like being sarcastic, but i'll be serious when needed,  
i stay up too late for no good reason, whether it's just talkin' or going through an existential crisis,  
i always pretend to dislike loud noises, but i also blast music into my brain whenever i'm alone ;-;  
i'm also super bad at making decisions, so it often takes me a long time to decide on something  

### likes
i like rainy afternoons, winter mornings, and nature,  
i love going out, playing games and chit-chatting with friends or my loved ones <3  
my fav game genres are factory, open-world, post-apocalyptic, etc.. (literally any lol)  
such as Minecraft, Mindustry, Factorio, Celeste, ADOFAI, Muse Dash, Oneshot, Stardew Valley, Rainworld, many many more...  
i enjoy spending hours watching movies and tv series (i even have my own watchlist :3)  
i like desaturated colors and vibrant ones sometimes  

### fun fact(s)
my birthday is in november, the rest is for you to figure out...  

### know me better (if u want)
i love talking, pls pls i love being disturbed (not when i'm working tho)  
i don't really ignore anyone on purpose, if that's actually the case, then i must really really hate u /j  
i notice small changes and details (so don't be surprised if i randomly talk about something that even u can't remember)  
i enjoy sharing my life stories with someone else, if u want to be a good friend of mine, listening would help alot
